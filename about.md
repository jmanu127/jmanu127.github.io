Hello. My name is Justin Manuel.

I like solving problems in machine intelligence and complex networks, whether it be in
computer systems, biological systems, or social and economic systems. I recently
finished my MS and I'm currently looking to move into tech.

### Education

I have a MS in Computer Science with a focus on computational perception and robotics from
Georgia Institute of Technology.

I also have a BS in Biological Sciences from Louisiana State University.

### Experience

I’m currently working in the forensic DNA field solving violent crimes. Before
forensics, I worked in a world leading epigenetics and obesity research laboratory attempting
to solve the global obesity epidemic.
